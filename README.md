Minetest Website Competition entry

Workflow
========

This site uses the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) static site generator as well
as the [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) CSS preprocessor.

* Use `jekyll serve` to automatically build the Jekyll site.
* Use `grunt watch` to compile Stylus files automatically. The Stylus files are
  located in `css/stylus`.
